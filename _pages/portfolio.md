## [CHMAP: Coronal Hole Mapping and Analysis Pipeline](https://predsci.github.io/CHMAP/)
CHMAP is a python package focused on the detection, mapping, tracking, and general analysis of coronal holes in the solar corona. CHMAP includes methods for:

  -Data Acquisition
  -Data Reduction
  -Limb Brightening Correction
  -Inter-Instrument Scaling
  -Flexible Map Creation
  -Coronal Hole Detection
  -Coronal Hole Tracking

## [Mesh Generator](https://pypi.org/project/mesh-generator/)
A Python package available on PyPI containing a collection of Python subroutines and examples that illustrate how to build a 1D Mesh with custom mesh spacing. The meshes created in the package can be used for variety of applications, including physical simulation. In particular, mesh-generator improved the efficiency of simulating coronal mass ejections (CME) by modifying the mesh resolution in areas of the solar active region.
