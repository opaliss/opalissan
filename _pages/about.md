About Me
======

I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working under the guidance of Prof. [Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html).
I am currently working on space-weather forecasting. In particular, developing methods of uncertainty quantification and reduced-order modeling methods to predict the solar wind and Earth's upper atmosphere. Before UC San Diego, I attended San Diego State University where I 
completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics under the guidance of Prof. [Christoper Curtis](https://cwcurtis.github.io/) while working as a Solar Physics Intern at [Predictive Science Inc](https://www.predsci.com/portal/home.php).

My research interests are in data assimilation, model order reduction, and computational plasma physics.

Upcoming Events
======
**Feb 27- March 1, 2024** I plan to attend SIAM Conference on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ24) in Trieste, Italy!

Recent News
======
**Sept 11, 2023** Our paper ["Bayesian Inference and Global Sensitivity Analysis for Ambient Solar Wind Prediction"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023SW003555) (with Pete Riley,  Enrico Camporeale, and Boris Kramer) posted online at Space Weather.

**Aug 20-25, 2023** I attended the [10th International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM23)](https://iciam2023.org/) in Tokyo, Japan, where I presented in the "Space Weather: Modeling, Surrogates and Uncertainty Quantification" mini-symposium on parameter estimation and global sensitivity analysis of ambient solar wind models. 

**June 5-July 28, 2023** It was great to attend the [Los Alamos National Laboratory Space Weather Summer School](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/national-security-education-center/space-earth-center/space-weather-school/index.php), which offered a variety of lectures in space weather (mainly focusing on magnetospheric physics). During the summer school, I got to work with Gian Luca Delzanno (LANL), Oleksandr Koshkarov (LANL), and Federico Halpern (General Atomics) on the anti-symmetric formulation of spectral methods for Vlasov- Poisson system. I learned a lot about spectral methods, the Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov-Poisson system, stability properties, and classic electrostatic instabilities.

**June 11-16, 2023** I presented about my [latest work]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08009)) in parameter estimation and global sensitivity analysis of ambient solar wind models at [Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM)](https://gemworkshop.org/).

**May 16, 2023** Our preprint ["Bayesian Inference and Global Sensitivity Analysis for Ambient Solar Wind Prediction"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08009) (with Pete Riley, Enrico Camporeale, and Boris Kramer) is available online at arXiv.

**May 10, 2023** Our work (with Boris Kramer) appeared in a SIAM News Blog post on [Speeding Up Solar Wind Forecasts with Reduced-order Modeling](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/speeding-up-solar-wind-forecasts-with-reduced-order-modeling).

**April 6-7, 2023** It was great to attend the [USACM Workshop on Establishing Benchmarks for Data-Driven Modeling of Physical Systems](https://sites.google.com/view/usacmdatabenchmarks/home) at University of Southern California (USC), where I presented about magnetohydrodynamic solar wind modeling and their corresponding mathematical challenges, i.e. high-dimensionality, complex nonlinearity, shock dynamics, advection-dominated phenomena, which make such models a great candidate for benchmark problems in model reduction and uncertainty quantification.

**March 17, 2023** Our preprint ["Exact and optimal quadratization of nonlinear finite-dimensional non-autonomous dynamical systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10285) (with Andrey Bychkov, Gleb Pogudin, and Boris Kramer) is available online at arXiv. 

**March 9-10, 2023**: I attended the [Space Weather with Quantified Uncertainties Spring Meeting 2023](https://linaresr.scripts.mit.edu/swqu/) and got to visit the MIT Haystack observatory! I presented a poster on variance-based global sensitivity analysis of ambient solar wind models. 

**Dec 22, 2022** I passed my Departmental Qualifying Exam (DQE) in computational fluid dynamics, fluid instabilities, and model order reduction.
