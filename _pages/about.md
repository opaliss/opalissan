About Me
======

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working under the guidance of Prof. [Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html).
I am currently working on space weather modeling and forecasting. In particular, applying methods of uncertainty quantification and reduced-order modeling to predict the solar wind and upper atmosphere. Before UC San Diego, I attended San Diego State University where I 
completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and worked under the guidance of  Prof. [Christopher Curtis](https://cwcurtis.github.io/). Furthermore, as an undergraduate, I worked as a Solar Physics Intern at [Predictive Science Inc.](https://www.predsci.com/portal/home.php) (2019-2021), where I developed mesh generation software, an algorithm to track spatiotemporal properties of coronal holes, and a technique to map solar wind streams from the Sun to Earth.

My research interests are in data assimilation, machine learning, model-order reduction, and computational fluid dynamics.
