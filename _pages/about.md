About Me
======
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. Boris Kramer. My current research is supervised by Gian Luca Delzanno at the Los Alamos National Laboratory T5 division, where we aim to understand how cold plasma effects whistler waves generated in Earth's inner magnetosphere. Another aspect of my research involves developing efficient numerical techniques for solving kinetic plasma equations.


Upcoming Events
======
**June 22-27, 2025** I look forward to attending GEM workshop in Des Moines, Iowa. I will be presenting a poster on my latest work understanding secondary drift-driven instabilities caused by whistler waves via quasilinear theory.
