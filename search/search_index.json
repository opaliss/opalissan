I am working under the guidance of Professor Christopher Curtis on finding a finite dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator using deep learning techniques. Furthermore, I am a solar physics intern at Predictive Science Inc. , working with Dr. Pete Riley on mapping solar wind streams from the Sun to 1 AU. In my graduate studies, I hope to gain critical insight on integrating machine learning techniques to extract principal information from data. These learning techniques play an important role in advancing our understanding of complex physics phenomena. My research interests are in mathematical modeling, numerical optimization, dynamical systems, and machine learning.
